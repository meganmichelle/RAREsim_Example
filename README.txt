# Example folder
 # Start to finish example simulation

*_input_sim_data.tar.gz
 # The ancestry specific (AFR, EAS, NFE, SAS) input simulation haplotypes used in RAREsim
 # Each tar ball contains haplotype and legend files for the cM blocks on Chromosome 19, as described in the  RAREsim manuscript.
 # The blocks have all sequence bases added within the coding region, to allow HAPGEN2 to simulate an abundance of variants
