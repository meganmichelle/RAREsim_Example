## The RAREsim Example folder  contains:

HAPGEN2_simulation folder:
 # Example code to simulate data with HAPGEN2

Pruning folder
 # Example code to prune the variants, based on the output from the pruning_variants.R function in the RAREsim R package

*_input_sim_data.tar.gz
 # The ancestry specific (AFR, EAS, NFE, SAS) input simulation haplotypes used in RAREsim
 # Each tar ball contains haplotype and legend files for the cM blocks on Chromosome 19, as described in the  RAREsim manuscript.
 # The blocks have all sequence bases added within the coding region, to allow HAPGEN2 to simulate an abundance of variants
